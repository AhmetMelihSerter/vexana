## Getting Started ðŸ”¥

Let's talk use detail.

### **Network Manager**

Have a a lot options: baseurl, logger, interceptors, base model etc.

```dart
        INetworkManager  networkManager =
            NetworkManager(isEnableLogger: true, options: BaseOptions(baseUrl: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/"));
```

### **Model Parse**

You have give to first parse model, second result model. (Result model could be list, model or primitive)

```dart
        final response =
        await networkManager.fetch<Todo, List<Todo>>("/todos", parseModel: Todo(), method: RequestType.GET);

```

### **Network Model**

You must be wrap model to INetoworkModel so we understand model has a toJson and toFrom properties.

```dart
    class Todo extends INetworkModel<Todo>
```
